# manhattanly 0.2.0 (2016-11-17)

## Major new features

* `volcanoly` function creates interactive volcano plots with automatic highlighting of points

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* By default, hover is based on the closest point rather than the x-coordinate (@mshadbolt, #1)
* `evaluate` argument deprecated (@thebioengineer, #4)
* Hover annotations for highlighted SNPs bug fixed (@mshadbolt, #6)
* Reduced size of `Introduction to manhattanly` vignette by using `html_vignette` (instead of `html_document`) which by default uses smaller plot sizes. See sahirbhatnagar.com/manhattanly for full vignette. 
* Fixed issue with hovering text when no annotation columns are provided: Problem variables: 'text' (@davemcg, #7)
